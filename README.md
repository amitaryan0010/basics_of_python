Getting Started
To start programming in Python, you need to install Python on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website python.org.

Once installed, you can write Python code in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook. I will use Jupyter Notebooks for this course.

Key Features
Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making the code visually structured and easy to read.

Dynamic Typing: Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you define it.

Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, which means you can run your code directly without compiling it into machine language.

Download
We can download the Anaconda from here and install into your system. Once done, then you launch the Jupyter notebook from Anaconda Navigator and start coding.



Let's write our first program:

Here, we have created a new notebook in Jupyter and wrote a simple print statement for greetings from Path4Cloud, going forward will discuss many other statement and will write more program and create projects.
